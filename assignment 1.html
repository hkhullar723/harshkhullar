            <h2>Early childhood</h2>
            Ronaldo was born in a very poor family. He is the fourth and youngest child of <b>Maria Dolores dos Santos
                Viveiros da Aveiro</b>, a cook, and <b>José Dinis Aveiro</b>, a municipal gardener and part-time kit
            man. His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism and having too
            many children already but her doctor refused to perform the procedure, as abortions were illegal in Portugal
            at that time. By age 14, Ronaldo agreed with his mother to cease his education to focus entirely on
            football. One year later, he was diagnosed with <a
                href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tachycardia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355127">tachycardia</a>.
            Ronaldo underwent heart surgery. He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed
            training a few days later.(Wikipedia)<br><br>
